I'm Vikshar, a current highschooler focused on hardware design and lowlevel development.  

I'm interested in the the areas of high-performance computing and quantum computing, and hope to work in those industries or ones adjacent to them in the future. I hope to use my knowledge in order to solve complex computing problems that we face in the future

You can see projects I've worked on [here](/projects), but here are a few highlights:\
[BBQScoutingPass](https://github.com/AlxV07/BBQScoutingPass): A Website & Mobile App for [Team 2714](https://www.team2714.com)'s Scouting software\
[Frog Dungeon Crawler](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/froggo_s_dungeon_adventures): A Dungeon Crawler made in Javascript for Hackclub's Sprig Handheld

\
Outside of the computer/technology space, things that interest me include
* Motorsport (Especially Formula One, Endurance Racing, and Time Attack)
* Car Tuning
* Fitness/Excercise
* Mechanical keyboards (I originally learned PCB design and circuits by building them from scratch)
* Guitar/Audio Gear

Feel free to contact me through the email link at the top of the website.
